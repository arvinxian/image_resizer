## introduction

Cause my girlfriend has the need of scale images in batch, after searching online sometimes, either not free or not good as need. so I just developed this little tool app based on Python3 and tkinter.

## Todo

- [x] 手动配置分辨率（宽度）Setting resolution(width) manually.
- [x] 支持拖动百分比，按宽度百分比来缩放 support drag width of percentage to scale
- [ ] support drag multiple image files or folder to app
- [ ] optimize the opening speed for builded app
- [ ] the ability to custom output folder
- [ ] save current configuration as default
